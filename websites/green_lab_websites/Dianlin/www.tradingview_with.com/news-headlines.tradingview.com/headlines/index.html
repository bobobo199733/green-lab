the massive paradigm shifts that erupted this year, more investors look toward cheap dividend stocks to buy. As inflationary forces diminished the dollar’s purchasing power in the first half of this year, many sought to arrest this trajectory through

cheap dividend stocks is that they offer stability at a discount. While it’s unfair to make blanket statements, companies pay dividends from their profits. Naturally, this circumstance implies earnings generation, meaning they’re not purely growth driven.

stocks to buy."]},{"type":"p","children":["For one thing, you can look at the company’s year-to-date performance in the equity price charts. JNJ is down about 3.7%, which arguably belies its all-around pertinence. More importantly, the underlying firm
provides a decent forward yield of 2.74%. Perhaps not the most remarkable figure, it does exceed the median yield of 1.58% for the healthcare segment."]},{"type":"p","children":["According to Gurufocus.com, JNJ is fairly valued. Fair enough. However,
Johnson \u0026 Johnson features financial strengths across the board. The company enjoys balance sheet stability, solid growth metrics, and excellent profitability indicators. Since stability commands a fundamental premium during these tumultuous times,

can see the damage for themselves. Since the start of the year, SAP stock has slipped nearly 38%. Still, for the contrarian, the crimson ink may represent an opportunity. As well, per the subject of this article on cheap dividend stocks to buy, SAP offers
passive income. Specifically, it provides a forward yield of 2.38%. In contrast, the technology sector’s average yield sits at 1.37%."]},{"type":"p","children":["Gurufocus.com labels SAP stock as modestly undervalued. As with JNJ, SAP enjoys solid financials
across the board, including solid growth metrics and a stable balance sheet. Perhaps most notably, SAP features a forward price-earnings ratio of 14.3x. The software industry’s median forward PE stands at 22x."]},{"type":"p","children":[]},{"type":"p","children":["Texas

Over the trailing year, it’s down a bit more at a loss of nearly 15%. Still, these represent far superior numbers than the underlying benchmark tech index. In addition, TXN separates itself from other tech plays by offering passive income. It features
a forward yield of 3%, above the average industry yield of 1.4%."]},{"type":"p","children":["Notably, Gurufocus.com labels TXN as modestly undervalued. Per the resource’s proprietary valuation metrics, it views Texas Instruments as an excellent all-around
investment. Most significantly, the company enjoys a net margin of nearly 44%, above approximately 98% of other tech firms. Therefore, TXN ranks easily among the best cheap dividend stocks to buy."]},{"type":"p","children":[]},{"type":"p","children":["Fastenal

from broader market volatility. Since the start of the year through the Oct. 4 session, Fastenal dropped 22% in equity value. However, contrarians might consider this an opportunity for an eventual economic comeback. To be fair, FAST doesn’t represent
one of the most generous cheap dividend stocks. Still, its forward yield of 2.58% beats the industry average of 2.36%."]},{"type":"p","children":["Moving onto Gurufocus.com, it labels Fastenal’s business as modestly undervalued. Per the investment resource,
the company commands excellent growth and profitability metrics. As well, its books are stable. For instance, Fastenal’s equity-to-asset ratio stands at 0.69, beating nearly 85% of sector peers."]},{"type":"p","children":[]},{"type":"p","children":["Robert

strange dynamics in the employer-employee relationship, RHI stock suffered from relevancy loss. Therefore, RHI slipped 27% YTD. Anecdotally, I’m almost sure that these strange dynamics will correct themselves. At the end of the day, employers sign the
checks. Employees must either put up or shut up. This statement is harsh, but it’s also a reality."]},{"type":"p","children":["Let’s look to Gurufocus.com for some numbers. RHI rates as modestly undervalued. Arguably, the company’s highlight financial
metric is its return-on-equity of nearly 50%, blasting the industry median of 8.6%. RHI also features a forward yield of 2.16%, which isn’t great. However, the combo of likely surging relevance (from desperate workers amid a possible recession) bolsters
the case for RHI as one of the cheap dividend stocks to buy."]},{"type":"p","children":[]},{"type":"p","children":["T. Rowe Price (TROW)"]},{"type":"p","children":["An investment management firm, T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW), may immediately appear to
be one of the cheap dividend stocks. However, critics may argue that it’s for the wrong reasons. As an investment management firm, T. Rowe performed well through 2021. The reason? Inflation, baby! With the greenback’s purchasing power guaranteed (under
the dovish monetary ecosystem) to decline, investors have an active incentive to invest. Otherwise, the dollar’s value goes into the toilet."]},{"type":"p","children":["Under a deflationary system – that is, rising purchasing power – the incentive flips
on its head. Essentially, if investors do nothing and sit on cash, they enjoy a guaranteed positive return of relative wealth. Thus, any investment opportunity must be so compelling that people will give up guaranteed returns. On a related note, that’s
the reason why, arguably, most folks hate deflationary cycles."]},{"type":"p","children":["Not surprisingly, then, Gurufocus.com considers TROW significantly undervalued. Still, contrarian investors may appreciate the opportunity as the underlying company
features its industry’s top-level growth and profitability metrics. In addition, T. Rowe features a forward yield of 4.24%."]},{"type":"p","children":[]},{"type":"p","children":["United Parcel Service (UPS)"]},{"type":"p","children":["If you thought buying
the above idea for cheap dividend stocks was extremely risky, look at United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS). I don’t want to spend too much time beating a dead horse. However, the consumer economy suffered badly this year. As a result, a rival courier service
disclosed terrible pre-earnings figures that sent shockwaves throughout the market in September."]},{"type":"p","children":["Understandably, UPS finds itself in the crosshairs. Nevertheless, its performance isn’t too awful, losing about 21% YTD in the
price charts. Fundamentally, the hesitation is understandable given that the ratio of e-commerce sales relative to total retail sales has diminished conspicuously since the Covid peak. Nevertheless, the ratio did pick up in the second quarter of this
year."]},{"type":"p","children":["For the extreme contrarian seeking cheap dividend stocks, Gurufocus.com labels UPS modestly undervalued. Despite incoming challenges, the company currently stands strong regarding growth and profitability metrics. The
deflated equity value and the forward yield of 3.6% might make shares worthwhile for gamblers."]},{"type":"p","children":["On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned

economy needs a supply-side revolution","sourceLogoId":"moneycontrol","published":1665055563,"source":"Moneycontrol","urgency":2,"link":"https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/opinion/worlds-economy-needs-a-supply-side-revolution-9286031.html","astDescription":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"p","children":["There's
a new religion in economic policymaking. It's a more modern view of supply-side economics with converts on both the right and the left. But what that means and how to achieve it is dividing policymakers. The different paths taken by the UK and Europe
may shed some insight."]},{"type":"p","children":["Prices and the amount of economic activity are determined by supply and demand. Supply is what the economy produces and the demand side is its appetite for goods and services. Both can be tinkered with
by policymakers."]},{"type":"p","children":["Supply-side economics used to have a bad name. In the 1980s it was the idea that if you cut taxes enough you would spur so much growth that the tax cuts would pay for themselves. This might be true if marginal
taxes are very high — as in, more than 95% — but at more normal levels it was wishful thinking. Cutting taxes is no free lunch. While the move can increase growth, that growth is usually not enough to make up for lost tax revenue."]},{"type":"p","children":["So
supply-side economics became a punchline. Supply concerns such as what the economy can make through workers’ skills and constraints on starting or building a business received less attention or outright mockery. The approach totally fell off the radar
during the Great Recession, which decimated household balance sheets and caused people to spend less. Instead, policymakers thought they could grow the economy by boosting demand: giving people money to spend or by the government spending more money."]},{"type":"p","children":["Consumption
is a big part of the economy, so the idea was that if people or the government demand more stuff, that would create more growth. Some economists argued demand was deficient throughout the economy, even during booms, and required lots of government spending
regardless. Boosting demand became the policy objective right up until the emergence of Covid, when the pandemic constrained supply. Attempts to boost demand in 2020 and 2021 were met with inflation, and so attention has swung back to working on the supply
side."]},{"type":"p","children":["And that brings a return of free-lunch thinking: that more stuff and productivity and cheaper housing and all that abundance will lower inflation. Certainly, worrying about supply is long overdue. Take housing: There
are many building restrictions that limit supply, which is one reason why prices are so high (prices are also high because government subsidizes demand, but this is so politically popular no one wants to touch it)."]},{"type":"p","children":["But there
is already disagreement on the best way to boost supply. Liberals are more inclined to industrial policy, which means the government picks desirable industries and gives them tax credits and subsidies to increase production. Traditional conservatives
are taking a get-out-of-the-way approach: They want fewer regulations and lower taxes. The difference comes down to whether you believe growth comes better from individual initiative and from starting businesses and allowing markets to direct their own
investment, or if you think it's better for the government to pick where resources go."]},{"type":"p","children":["The government approach makes sense if you think markets send capital to the wrong places, or when the economy needs projects that require
so much fixed investment the government needs to make the first move."]},{"type":"p","children":["The Biden administration has mostly been pursuing this more-government approach, which describes many of the provisions in the Build Back Better bill (though
much of the original plan didn't pass Congress). Odds are we’ll see more of it. Even conservatives in America have become fans of industrial policy."]},{"type":"p","children":["And now we have the makings of a real-world experiment overseas. The UK’s
new prime minister wants to try the get-out-of the way approach with tax cuts and clawing back regulations. The hope is that this would reduce disincentives to work, innovate and start new businesses. So far, markets have not been very receptive, to say
the least. In part because the timing suggests the government is not making inflation a priority since it intends to finance the proposed tax cuts by running bigger deficits. There is also good reason to believe that any growth created would be counteracted
by further rate increases from the Bank of England in its fight against inflation."]},{"type":"p","children":["The execution and communication around Liz Truss's proposed cuts has also been atrocious, as Clive Crook points out. But some of the criticism
and market reaction was overblown. The tax reductions were actually not that large, about £45 billion ($52 billion) out of her overall £160 billion plan — and only about £2 billion of that was reversed. A lot of money is going to energy subsidies. And
the overall idea is sound to let growth happen from the ground up by removing economic obstacles and disincentives."]},{"type":"p","children":["Meanwhile, Europe is getting far less attention for trying the government-led approach and spending a similar
amount of money relative to its GDP. The EU, which never met a regulation it didn’t love, has allocated €806 billion ($804 billion) for various forms of industrial policy including digital infrastructure and battery production, plus an additional €1.2
trillion for Europe’s Green New Deal (the war in Ukraine might change these plans), with individual countries kicking in some extra spending to meet these objectives. France, for instance, has a bigger debt-to-GDP ratio than the UK but is planning on
spending €100 billion (40% financed from the EU, the rest with debt) on the initiative. European governments are also spending big on energy subsidies."]},{"type":"p","children":["So which approach will work best? It depends. The key to future growth
from the supply side is the innovation it produces. This is the only free lunch because when you innovate you can make more stuff with fewer goods and improve living standards. But innovation is inherently a messy, risky and unpredictable process. Industrial
policy does not have a great track record of picking winners — it's hard when there is so much uncertainty about which innovations will be the big game changers. When there is a clear need for a project and it is well-executed, such as Operation Warp
Speed for Covid vaccines or the Manhattan Project to produce nuclear weapons, government investment can be effective. Infrastructure spending can also accelerate growth if it picks the right projects, though there have been some real clunkers and waste
there too."]},{"type":"p","children":["Tax cuts also largely depend on execution. Tax cuts financed with deficits are less effective, and the best tax reform removes loopholes and other distortions as well as lowering rates. Deregulation also has a good
track record if well done."]},{"type":"p","children":["I am a market-inclined person, so I tend to favor the get-out-of-the way approach. I have more faith in individuals and a market that rations risk than I do in government bureaucrats. But which approach
works better really comes down to how well it’s executed and the problem that it's trying to solve."]},{"type":"p","children":["Both spending and tax cuts can be inflationary, at least in the short to medium term, because expanding supply can take years
while the effect of the spending or tax cuts on demand is felt immediately. Yet, there is a strong political bias toward the spending approach. Deficit-financed government spending is often seen as taking a wise, albeit levered, investment in the future,
while deficit-financed tax cuts are seen as wasteful giveaways to the rich. But really, they are two sides of the same coin."]},{"type":"p","children":["The supply side may not get too much traction in the near future. With rising rates and inflation
and scarce energy, most countries don’t have the fiscal space to deploy deficit-financed tax cuts or spending. Liz Truss has already nixed rate cuts going to the highest earners. Deregulation is costless, and can even save money, but requires taking on
special interests. Following the pandemic there is a bias toward more intervention. But with lower productivity and aging populations, all developed countries need a supply-side revolution."]},{"type":"p","children":["Allison Schrager is a Bloomberg Opinion

It’s Never Too Late to Start Building Resilience "]}]},{"type":"p","children":["When it comes to start building sustainable resilience in corporate entities, there is immense power in the Power of Now. Building organizational resilience is no child’s
play — it requires deliberate intentionality and a tremendous amount of energy, time, effort, persistence, discipline and flexibility. There are low hanging fruits to be plucked, and often some gains of the effort arrive rather early. "]},{"type":"p","children":[{"type":"b","children":["Second,
Leadership Holds the Key "]}]},{"type":"p","children":["In this uncertain, turbulent world, it is impossible to predict the future and despite corporations having developed specific resilience capabilities, when sudden disruptions occur, surprise gaps
in those capabilities become visible and it is here that the leader plays the critical role. "]},{"type":"p","children":["Sustainable organizational resilience begins with some attributes so far not considered central to leadership capabilities. These
are absolute calmness amid turbulence, ability to lead with empathy and awareness, inherent capacity to create an organizational culture where genuine mistakes are condoned and innovations rewarded. A resilient leader must be able to rapidly connect with
stakeholders; positivity, creativity and ability to experiment have to be his/her first nature "]},{"type":"p","children":[{"type":"b","children":["Three, Resilience is a Culture Thing "]}]},{"type":"p","children":["Leadership and culture are congenital
twins; unless the leadership creates a culture where resilience thrives there is no sustainability. "]},{"type":"p","children":["Creating culture where resilience thrives is the primary responsibility of the leader. The leader also has to empower resilience

Communication with Stakeholders – Internal and External "]}]},{"type":"p","children":["Resilience takes centre-stage when disruptive changes happen increasingly abruptly and unpredictably. Such situations will require quick measures to stop loss and rapidly

It Is Innovation, Stupid, That Will Keep the Resilient Organization Going "]}]},{"type":"p","children":["Gone is the era of divisions, departments, compartments, and silos. A resilient company thrives on innovation and is perpetually in start-up and incubation

system of periodic preparation, comprehensive risk framework and monitoring was suitable to companies of yesteryears, Resilient companies use data mining, digital technology and artificial intelligence, and for them end-to-end risk management is a round-the-clock

production capacity that can be flexible to meet demand changes as well as remain stable when operational disruption happens "]},{"type":"p","children":["Thirdly, Technological resilience with investment in strong, secure and flexible infrastructure,
including managing cyber threats, technology breakdown avoidance, disaster-recovery capability and a system that uses high-quality data, duly respecting privacy, without bias and compliant with regulatory requirements "]},{"type":"p","children":["Fourthly,
Organizational resilience that creates a diverse, inclusive, equal opportunity workplace that recruits best talent, develop that talent equitably, upskill or rapidly reskill it flexibly, implements strong people bias-free processes, with a pan-organization,
robust succession plans "]},{"type":"p","children":["Fifthly, Reputational resilience, one wherein institutions align their values with their actions and words. Resilience demands a strong sense of self—enshrined in mission, values, and purpose, which
guides actions, along with flexibility and openness in listening to and communicating with stakeholders, anticipating and addressing societal expectations and responding to criticism of the firm’s behaviour. "]},{"type":"p","children":["Lastly Business-model
resilience, one that can adapt swiftly to significant shifts in customer demand, the competitive landscape, technological changes and the regulatory terrain. "]},{"type":"p","children":["It is a no-brainer that the firms with capabilities to prepare for

governments are facing a choice of which kind of crisis to have: an energy crisis or a fiscal crisis. The global economy may hang in the balance."]},{"type":"p","children":["Estimates of the size of the energy price shock vary, but one plausible assessment
runs in the range of 6% to 8% of GDP for Europe. One response to this shock would be to let energy prices rise and allow the private sector to adjust. This would mean higher costs for manufacturing, higher home heating bills, and lower disposable income
to spend on other goods and services. In broad terms, it would be like the energy price shock of 1979 and the following recession."]},{"type":"p","children":["Note that the size of the recession is typically larger than the size of the initial price shock.
As some sectors start to contract, they bring down other sectors with them. Asset prices will fall as well, which in turn damages investment and consumption. Economists sometimes call this “real business cycle theory,” a branch of knowledge which investigates
how an initial negative event can spread."]},{"type":"p","children":["That is not just an imaginary economic tale. Recent data indicate that German exports are taking a severe hit, although some of this decline is due to non-energy-related problems."]},{"type":"p","children":["That
sounds grim, but it is important to realize that there is a different yet equally grim path: Governments could take this energy price shock and turn it into a fiscal shock instead."]},{"type":"p","children":["If a government picks up enough of the increase
in the energy bill, it would be as if the energy price shock never happened. In its polar form such a policy would be difficult to pull off, but there have already been some moves in that direction. The UK government is committing a possible £200 billion
toward insulating the UK economy from energy price shocks, though much of the energy price shock still will still make its way into the economy. The German economy has also unveiled a plan to spend about €200 billion to protect the economy from energy
price shocks."]},{"type":"p","children":["Governments can try to limit energy price shocks in different ways. They can try to make consumers and businesses whole again with subsidies and income transfers, for example, or they can cap prices and then try
to make the energy companies whole again. Whatever the exact mix of policies, the extra cost will put a big hole in government budgets."]},{"type":"p","children":["If a government picked up the entire extra energy cost, it would cost something in the
range of 6% to 8% of GDP — and that cost would need to be incurred every year that energy prices stayed high. That would require more government borrowing, higher taxes, more money printing, or some mix of those options."]},{"type":"p","children":["The
good news is that turning an energy crisis into a fiscal crisis doesn’t spread high energy costs through the entire economy. The bad news is twofold: First, keeping energy prices low does nothing to encourage conservation. Second, and more important,
a fiscal crisis is still a crisis. Even if a government eschews extra borrowing, how much room is there to raise taxes, given economic and political constraints?"]},{"type":"p","children":["In the late 1970s, there was no general move to turn the energy
price crisis into a (possible) fiscal crisis. Governments then didn’t think they could get away with the levels of borrowing they now routinely countenance."]},{"type":"p","children":["So this is a moment of policy innovation: Call it the fiscalization
of economic problems. The pandemic is another very recent example. For how long can the world fiscalize its problems? Can fiscalization help the world avoid major economic crises?"]},{"type":"p","children":["Maybe this is only the beginning for super-high
debt levels as a form of insurance against very bad luck. Or maybe the bond markets are on the verge of rebelling against such continued borrowing — and such debt will wreck the fiscal compact behind the European Union, given the common view that at least
some of those countries will end up abusing their borrowing privileges. Real interest rates, remember, have been rising lately."]},{"type":"p","children":["In short: None of these scenarios is especially upbeat, no one really knows what they are doing,
and the eventual outcome will probably be dictated by the bond market. Have a nice day."]},{"type":"p","children":["Tyler Cowen is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. Views are personal, and do not represent the stand of this publication."]},{"type":"p","children":["Credit:
